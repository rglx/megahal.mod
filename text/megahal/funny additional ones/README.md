# note:

some of these came with one of my many rescued copies of megahal, i'm just keeping them here for posterity's sake

append to your existing megahal.trn in megahal's resources directory and re-train (as in, delete the brain of) your bot

or find some way to flood it all to the bot that doesn't involve getting k-lined from your irc network.
